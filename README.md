# Wavey App
I wanted to try to develop something in react-native to learn it. After attending a 5Rhythms dance workshop I wanted to create a small helper which will allow me to practise switching between different styles with audio cue... and maybe add some music to it later.

## The default sequence
*Wave*: Flow - Staccato - Chaos - Lyrical - Stillness

3 min of each rhythm for one wave. Then 20 seconds of each rhythm for another wave.
Two waves. 15 min + 100 second

S SS SSS SSSS SSSSS .... 
S - sound cue.
